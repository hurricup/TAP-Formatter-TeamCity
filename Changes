* Test diagnostics are now passed through to STDOUT and STDERR, and these will
  be presented by TeamCity in the "details" for each test failure. However,
  TeamCity strips out the newlines, so the presentation isn't very pretty.

  The code for doing this is not very pretty either. TeamCity is sensitive
  about the order of the messages is receives.  So all the diagnostic info has
  to come between the testStarted and testFinished messages.  But with TAP, it
  isn't easy to know where the test begins and ends.

* It seems to work for now, but I'll probably re-write it in the near future.
